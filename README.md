# DailyplannerAc

The Day Planner application allows users to keep track of every event of the day at every hour. Powered by jQuery, the app runs in the browser and dynamically updates HTML and CSS. In our app, events can be entered between 7am and 4pm for each hour. The user can save the events to the app's local storage when they click the save button for a particular hour, so if they refresh the page, their saved events are not lost.

A color-coded time block enables the user to distinguish between past, present, and future events in our application. A time block in the past is colored gray, a time block in the present/current period is colored red, and a time block in the future is colored green.
